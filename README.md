Javanese Transliteration (Nulisa Aksara Jawa)

2020

Couple things to note
* Sorry I just made the README.md now
* This is about Javanese script in Java, Indonesia
* This is not about JavaScript or Java language
* This is not even about Javanese language, as Javanese script were historically and still is used by various languages, Javanese, Indonesian, heck,  you can even try to write English or Chinese (ask me about it)
* This is a transliterator
* This is not a translator
* This repo is very messy, just like me
* This repo is not going to be cleaned soon. It has a lot of stuff that probably doesn't relate to the project. Feel free to fork it and clean it, and improve it, etc. I expect to see issues and pull request.
* This is not a traditional repo in Github sense. I treat this repo more like a wiki that I edit via web.
* As a proof of that, I even host the main script on-wiki https://jv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Panganggo:Bennylin/trans.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript. Why? Because I like and prefer the diff there: https://jv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Panganggo:Bennylin/trans.js&action=history
* I'm planning to continue the development of the transliterator more toward keyboards (see my keyman keyboards in github.com/bennylin/keyboards)
* This was planned to be used in Wikipedia (Javanese Wikipedia: jv.wikipedia.org), but then it turned out I have separate code for that github.com/bennylin/jquery.ime/tree/master/rules/jv)
* I was hoping people would submit issues and pull request here (none as of 7 years in the project), but mostly the feedback that I got was from Facebook (I set up Facebook comment on the http://bennylin.github.io/transliterasijawa/ page, but have since 2015-ish i I have stopped using Facebook and moving to Telegram)
* Recently (March 2020) after I finished meeting with people in Javanese Script Pre-Congress (Pra-Kongres Aksara Jawa), I started to see more activity in the direction of keyboard development
* So it probably means I would focus on Keyman keyboards from now on, and I would leave this repo like this for the foreseeable future.
* I see people start using the script: https://github.com/karnadii/flutter_aksara and others. A shoutback would be welcomed.
