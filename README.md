Javanese Transliteration (Nulisa Aksara Jawa)

2020

Couple things to note
* Sorry I just made the README.md now
* This is about Javanese script of Java, Indonesia
* This is not about JavaScript or Java language (computer programming language)
* This is not even about Javanese language in  Indonesia, as Javanese script were historically and still is used by various languages, Javanese, Madurese, Sundanese, Indonesian, heck,  you can even try to write English or Chinese (ask me about it)
* This is a transliterator (id: mesin pengalihaksarsa)
* This is not a translator (id: bukan mesin penerjemah)
* I'm planning to continue the development of the transliterator more toward keyboards (see my keyman keyboards in https://bennylin.github.io)
** PS: 2020-21: I'm continuing the development of this transliterator for my pet projects.
* This was planned to be used in Wikipedia (Javanese Wikipedia: https://jv.wikipedia.org), but then it turned out I have separate code for that https://github.com/bennylin/jquery.ime/tree/master/rules/jv)
** Wikipedia did use a version of my transliteration (developed separately / branched from this). See: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Extension:UniversalLanguageSelector/Input_methods/jv-transliteration
* I was hoping people would submit issues and pull request here (none as of 7 years in the project), but mostly the feedback that I got was from Facebook (I set up Facebook comment on the page), and no pull request yet. https://github.com/bennylin/transliterasijawa/pulls
* Recently (March 2020) after I finished meeting with people in Javanese Script Pre-Congress (Pra-Kongres Aksara Jawa), I started to see more activity in the direction of keyboard development
* So it probably means I would focus on Keyman keyboards from now on, and I would leave this repo like this for the foreseeable future.
* I see people start using the script: https://github.com/karnadii/flutter_aksara and others. A shoutback would be welcomed.
