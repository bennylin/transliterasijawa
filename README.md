Javanese Transliteration (Nulisa Aksara Jawa)

2020

Couple things to note
* Sorry I just made the README.md now
* This is about Javanese script in Java, Indonesia
* This is not about JavaScript or Java language
* This is not even about Javanese language, as Javanese script were historically and still is used by various languages, Javanese, Indonesian, heck,  you can even try to write English or Chinese (ask me about it)
* This is a transliterator
* This is not a translator
* This repo is very messy, just like me
* This repo is not going to be cleaned soon
* I'm planning to continue the development of the transliterator more toward keyboards (see my keyman keyboards in github.com/bennylin/keyboards)
* This was planned to be used in Wikipedia (Javanese Wikipedia: jv.wikipedia.org), but then it turned out I have separate code for that github.com/bennylin/jquery.ime/tree/master/rules/jv)
* I was hoping people would submit issues and pull request here, but mostly the feedback that I got was from Facebook (I set up Facebook comment on the http://bennylin.github.io/transliterasijawa/ page, but have since 2015-ish stopped using Facebook and moving to Telegram)
* Recently (March 2020) after I finished meeting with people in Javanese Script Pre-Congress (Pra-Kongres Aksara Jawa), I started to see more activity in the direction of keyboard development
* So it probably means I would focus on Keyman keyboards from now on, and I would leave this repo like this for the foreseeable future.
* I see people start using the script: https://github.com/karnadii/flutter_aksara and others. A shoutback would be welcomed.
